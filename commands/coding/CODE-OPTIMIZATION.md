# Code Optimization

## Overview
Optimize code for better performance, efficiency, and resource usage while maintaining readability.

## Optimization Areas

### Performance
- [ ] Identify performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Optimize algorithmic complexity (Big O)
- [ ] Reduce unnecessary computations
- [ ] Implement caching strategies
- [ ] Use efficient data structures
- [ ] Minimize memory allocations
- [ ] Optimize loops and iterations

### Memory
- [ ] Identify memory leaks
- [ ] Reduce memory footprint
- [ ] Use generators for large datasets
- [ ] Implement lazy loading
- [ ] Clean up unused resources

### Network & I/O
- [ ] Batch API calls
- [ ] Implement connection pooling
- [ ] Use async/await for I/O operations
- [ ] Compress data transfer
- [ ] Implement pagination

### Database
- [ ] Optimize queries (indexes, joins)
- [ ] Reduce N+1 query problems
- [ ] Use query caching
- [ ] Implement connection pooling
- [ ] Batch operations where possible

## Analysis Steps
1. Profile code to find bottlenecks
2. Measure current performance metrics
3. Identify optimization opportunities
4. Implement optimizations incrementally
5. Benchmark and verify improvements
6. Document changes and trade-offs

## Best Practices
- Measure before optimizing (avoid premature optimization)
- Focus on actual bottlenecks
- Consider readability vs performance trade-offs
- Document optimization decisions
- Add performance tests
