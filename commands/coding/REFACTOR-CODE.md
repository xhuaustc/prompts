# Refactor Code

## Overview
Improve code quality, readability, and maintainability through systematic refactoring while preserving functionality.

## Refactoring Goals
1. **Improve Readability**: Make code easier to understand
2. **Reduce Complexity**: Simplify complex logic
3. **Remove Duplication**: Apply DRY principle
4. **Enhance Performance**: Optimize where needed
5. **Improve Structure**: Better organize code architecture

## Refactoring Checklist
- [ ] Identify code smells and anti-patterns
- [ ] Extract repeated code into reusable functions
- [ ] Rename variables/functions for clarity
- [ ] Split large functions into smaller ones
- [ ] Improve data structures and algorithms
- [ ] Remove dead code and unused imports
- [ ] Optimize nested loops and conditionals
- [ ] Add missing type annotations
- [ ] Improve error handling
- [ ] Ensure backwards compatibility

## Steps
1. Analyze current code structure
2. Identify areas for improvement
3. Plan refactoring approach
4. Make incremental changes
5. Test after each change
6. Document significant changes

## Safety Rules
- Preserve existing functionality
- Maintain test coverage
- Keep changes focused and incremental
- Run tests frequently during refactoring
